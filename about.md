Hi. My name's Nick. Thanks for joining me here. I was born and raised in Houston, TX before moving to Nashville, TN for university. I studied there for 4 years at Vanderbilt University, majoring in economics and film studies. After school, I decided I'd like to stay and try my hand at songwriting. I did a lot of other stuff, too. Basically, your token millenial.

After trying my hand at code, I decided to take it a step further and attended the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs in Vancouver, BC.

The idea of a dynamic environment of constantly creating, learning, and problem-solving with critical thinking drew me to the world of development. I've enjoyed it immensely as every day is full of new ideas, challenges, and technologies.

I enjoy how cool the other side of the pillow is, hole-in-the-wall dive bars with karaoke, a good California Zin, most competitions (especially Houston sports and board games), the oxford comma, any and all things related to Mexican food, and the landing of a well-performed line in a song, film, or play.

Thanks for joining me. I hope you find my very informal, mostly uneducated musings either entertaining, insightful, or both. Cheers.
