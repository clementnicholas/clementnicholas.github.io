title: "The Struggle of Unfamiliar Tech as a Junior"

Today marked the last official Wednesday for my cohort at lighthouse. I won't harp anymore on how much we've learned but here's a brief timeline from now until the end. We graduate Friday, but our final projects aren't demo-ing til next Thursday. Basically, We should have an MVP in two days and then we just build sweet features to make the app even more awesome.

I won't lie, this has been a fairly grueling final in a number of ways. Babylon is not only completely unfamiliar to us, we also don't really have a lot of people with game development experience to guide us. No one has used babylon here before pretty much. 

We've had our fair share of frustration and excitement, as each day is filled with progress and setbacks. All in all, the progress probably outweighs it, but it also feels like we are in the dark a bit. Kind of like we are wandering through the desert without direction, yet still loving the journey. I'm confident we will get to where we want to be by next Thursday.

Most of these struggles come from "what it's actually like to be a developer" as our instructors would say. Our current structure works, and it's fine scalability-wise for how small our project is, but it isn't necessarily super maintainable or flexible if we want to expand upon it. There's a feeling that we are misusing some attributes of BABYLON. 

Today, we faced a decision to majorly refactor the code or to just aim for MVP. We chose MVP with the hope of refactoring once that was reached. Also, there are elements of the art and 3D renderings that are conceptually so foreign. The DOCS aren't that great either so it's pretty mysterious sometimes and very interesting.

All in all, I'm glad we are working in a new tech because it really is simulating what life is going to be like for a long time. And the fact that we are producing something and having to learn pretty much everything we are using will serve us well. But DAMN, it puts me in my place. I definitely feel like a junior and I imagine I'll feel this way for a long time. But as long as I step back and know that I am actually learning and am actually progressing as a developer, I'm more than okay feeling like that.
