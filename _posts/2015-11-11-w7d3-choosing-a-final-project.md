Today, we chose our final project. I'm working with some of my favorite dudes in the cohort, and after kicking around multiple ideas, we decided that it would be most fun to build a game. Chances are, this may be the only time we really get to focus on a project like this, so why not. Also, we have 15 days, and it should be something FUN that introduces us to new tech. 

We are building a game based on a spaceship navigating obstacles using the gravitational pull of black holes in order to reach a destination point. A fairly simple concept, but there are a lot of cool things going on here. The biggest decisions are the technologies/engines we want to use. 

Obviously, there are some cool tools for the physics of this, the gameplay and states of game, and the graphics of this. I love this project because it's heavy logic and heavy ux/ui which are two of my highest levels of interest. 

We've looked at processing.js, cannon.js, and the physics components of various game engines to deal with some of the calculations. We also played around with phaser.js for the gameplay. The biggest thing that has gotten us fired up though, is the 3d engines we could use and there various possibilities. Babylon.js and three.js were both really fun to play around in today, and we are looking forward to getting to know them more. Hopefully, we will have some decisions made on what we want to use by the end of the day tomorrow. 

Anyways, that's all for today!
