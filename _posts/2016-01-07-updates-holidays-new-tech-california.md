Long time, no talk. Since I left you, I've been to San Francisco, Houston, Park City, and now back to San Francisco for hopefully awhile, job pending. I visited family, ate really well, saw old friends, made new friends, celebrated holidays, skied, and even found some time to dabble in new topics for me. 

I've split my time between tutorials, readings, job applications and building projects. I've mostly focused on advanced javascript concepts and frameworks. Here's an abbreviated list of things I've looked at (all of them to different extents):
>  The event loop.
>  Prototypal inheritance.
>  Functional Programming.
>  Two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.
>  React, Flux, Alt, Redux, Webpack, Firebase.
>  Angular.
>  MDN Documentation
>  Apply, Call, and Bind.
>  Blocking functions and Async Javascript
>  D3.js
>  Data Structures, Algorithms, and basic Comp Sci fundamentals.
>  ES6 and 7 
>  Promises

I've also found some great others that I'm sure the world has already heard of and an awesome new podcast.
>  Javascript Air - http://javascriptair.com/
>  Eric Elliot - https://medium.com/@_ericelliott - great for JS advanced topics
>  Kent C Dodds - https://medium.com/@kentcdodds - also great for JS
>  Douglas Cockford
>  SurviveJS Tutorials - https://survivejs.com/
>  HTML5 Weekly Newsletter
>  Javascript Weekly Newsletter

Anyways, as you can see I'm extremely focused right now on sharpening my Javascript chops and really understanding how the language works. Libraries and frameworks currently are secondary to learning the deeper fundamentals of what it allows you to do and best practices for building in it.
