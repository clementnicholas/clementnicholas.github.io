Today, I booked my flight to leave Vancouver. It was bittersweet, but given the purpose of this blog, I won't go on and on about it. I was lucky enough to have a chance to experience Whistler before I left, so that's what the weekend held for me. Other than that, here's an update on the past few days besides the normal job-hunting stuff.

In lecture, we've had some serious fun looking at socket.io. Let's just say, when you're playing around with this by creating games where certain security is compromised, we can have a lot of fun. 

For our game, we've spent a good amount of time playing around with the babylon.js. It's pretty great for gameplay and 3d renderings because it works well with WebGL. Also, a guy in our group created our server in python, which is pretty sweet considering none of us have ever touched that technology. Just speaks to the power of Lighthouse Labs and the way in which they equip you to dive into implementing new technologies (I really feel as if I lucked out as far as coding bootcamps go).

Anyways, I've learned a lot about managing states in javascript and callback functions in the past few days. That's mainly been what we've had challenges with since it is gameplay, and there are a lot of different states to work with. Good luck with the week everyone! Until next time, thanks for reading.
