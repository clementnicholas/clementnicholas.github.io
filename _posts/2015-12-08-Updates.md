Hey there, been awhile. Been a crazy few weeks. Here's what happened.

Finished our final game. Had a lot of fun. Also had a lot of frustration. I would say I was relatively pleased with the way it ended up. Seemed to go over well at our demo day.

Said goodbye to Vancouver, an amazing city. But was certainly bittersweet. Very happy to be back in the states.

I've been in LA/Santa Monica for the past week visiting friends and studying/working on projects. I've learned a lot but also feel slightly directionless. Having a concrete list of portfolio pieces to build would be quite helpful right now. But alas, I'm on my own to be self-motivated. I'd give myself a solid B- to B in that regard.

There's a podcast called Developer Tea that I've listened to a bunch this week. It talks about a lot of different problems/issues/ideas you run into as a developer, and it's definitely helped me with my mindset. I've started to scratch the surface of a wide variety of technologies and it's time to focus on one and build. So that's the plan right now.

I'm off to San Francisco today for another week and then home to Texas for the holidays. More to come as I have more updates on new projects... That's all for now though.
